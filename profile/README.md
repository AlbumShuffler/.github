# Album Shuffler
This organization contains all repositories for the Album Shuffler web app.
See a live demo of the app here:

https://kassettenwechsler.de/

Basically, it allows you to define a set of artists and/or playlists and the web app will then suggest albums of these artists/playlists for you to listen to.

The app is tailored to Spotify. All metadata will be retrieved from Spotify and the play button will take you directly into the Spotify app (on mobile) or the web interface.

To get started visit the [frontend repository](https://github.com/AlbumShuffler/Frontend)!
